## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **first-year B.Tech student at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science**, focused on building **full-stack web applications** and **applied AI tools**.

I like solving problems that are actually annoying in real life.  
Not demo problems. Not toy apps. Real use cases.

Most of my work focuses on:
- Campus utilities  
- Healthcare-adjacent applications  
- Clear UX with reliable backend logic  

I value **clarity, maintainability, and usefulness** more than flashy features.
