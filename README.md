**Hi, I’m Suhani Choudhary 👋**

I’m a first-year web development student at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, building full-stack web apps and practical AI projects. I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into simple, usable tools — especially when they help people on campus or in healthcare.

🚀 About & Focus

I focus on building practical, well-documented projects that combine web development and applied AI. My priorities are reliability, clear UX, and clean architecture — from frontend to deployment.

Interests: Web development, conversational AI, product design for campus/education use cases, and deployment/DevOps basics.
